    "In order to write useful programs, we almost always need the ability to check conditions and change the behavior of the program accordingly. Conditional statements give us this ability. The simplest form is the if statement:\n",

    "    print 'x is positive'\n",
    "```\n",

    "Sometimes there are more than two possibilities and we need more than two branches. One way to express a computation like that is a chained conditional:\n",
